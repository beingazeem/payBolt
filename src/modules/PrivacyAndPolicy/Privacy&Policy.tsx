        13. CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you sign up to become a Member, you might be asked to choose a
        password and opt for OTP verification. You are entirely responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of your password and OTP. It is
        important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your
        account and information by choosing your password carefully and keeping
        your password and computer secure by signing out after using our
        services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of
        another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third
        party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
        information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your
        password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
        identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions
        taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised
        for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree
        to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use
        of your account or access to your password even after changing it.
